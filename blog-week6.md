# Week 6 #

## What did you learn that helped you understand the development process? ##

I learned several important aspects of coding that helped me better understand the development process. This week, I better learned how powerful parameters in functions can be. It opened up a whole new way of understanding how to better implement the DRY method. I also learned how to implement API's. This was incredibly fun and also deepened my understanding of how powerful objects are.

## What does it mean to develop good code? ##

To develop good code, you have to do one simple thing: communicate. There are 13 of us in this boot camp, and each week, we work on the same exact project. When demo day comes, there are 13 unique ways to solve the same problem. What this conveys to me, is that the end solution isn't more important than communicating *how* you got to your solution. In the future, we will be working with teams. We will most likely inherit some code as well. We will have to communicate with one anther to synthesize a solution that is readable and cohesive versus hodge-podge. We will also have to heavily comment our code, just like we would have liked our inherited code to be commented. 

## What does it mean to be a good developer? ##

A good developer has to be open to many different possible solutions (because there are at least 13 possible solutions). They have to be humble enough to ask for help, and collaborative enough to give help. They also have to be flexible enough to work with stringent deadline and very strict guidelines.  

## What is one thing that programmers hate doing? ##

I bet one thing programmers hate doing is finding typos. If one variable is spelled wrong throughout the code, I bet it is a pain to find. I can't imagine going through someones code who isn't a very good speller.
