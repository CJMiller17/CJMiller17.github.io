# Week 5 #

>"Find your ***why*** and you'll find your ***way***. -John Maxwell"

## What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why? ##

I think the number one thing that held me back this week was rushing into coding before having a plan. I really should have taken the time to read and re-read the assignment. I also should have taken a greater amount of time to pseudocode my plan out. Especially after demo day, I saw how important a robust pseudocode process is. As my classmates presented their projects, I could tell that they had a plan before typing up their code and that they were able to get through their logic because they pseudocoded before hand.

## What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design? ##

I would like to know how to use objects more. With this mind-reading project, I challenged myself by using objects and arrays of objects. I don't fully understand them, but I can tell that they are a powerful tool. The fact that you can call variables or functions from a key-value pair seems like there could be endless possibilities. I would also like to see what amazing things I can do with them by incorporating them into my code.

## What is your “Why”? ##

I believe compassion is my *why*. When I first went to college, I studied legal studies with the intent of becoming a public . I liked the idea of defending people too poor to afford a lawyer.

Many years later, I would return to finish my degree, but this time I studied international development with the aim on poverty alleviation. I got into banking to see how a bank works and how lending decisions are made because I wanted to see how micro-lending could work as a means to help the poor. 

A change to web development might seem odd, but it is still a part of my *why*. With the freedom to work from home, my wife and I will be able to travel to the places we would want to work with and give aid to. With greater financial freedom comes the ability to give more and help grow effective non-profits.
