## What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely? ##

The flexibility to be the stay at home parent who could watch our son during the day and work at night. My wife works from home and has a lot of flexibility as well, but some of her meetings **have** to happen at certain times during normal working hours.

## What hindered your progress during Onboarding? ##

Ironically, being the stay at home parent. My son loves screens and tried playing with my laptop every time I tried coding. Also, trying to read, comprehend and learn were hard when that was taking place in a piecemeal fashion. A little reading here, a little reading here. What was that I just learned? How do I do that again? I am also more of an audio-visual learner, so seeing and hearing at the same time help me to retain information much better.

## How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding? ##
