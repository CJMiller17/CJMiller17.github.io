## What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish? ##
<br>
To extend the amount of time in a day. If someone knows how to code for that, I would be eternally grateful. I would have all the time in the world to thank you! All joking aside, I wish I was more proficient in CSS. There seems to be an unlimited number of possibilities of what a page *could* look like, that I don't even know *what* I want my page to look like. I like to know what my options are before I make a decision, which just isn't possible with so many options.  
<br>
## What are you struggling with? ##
<br>
I think I am struggling with time management and/or just having enough time in general. I take care of our son while my wifes works during the day. I then "put in my hours" while he is napping and after he has gone to bed. However, that means that my brain is not at it's freshest while I am tackling coding challenges or trying to understand a new development principle. 
<br>
## How do you solve a problem? ##
<br>
I typically try to asses what the problem is. How wide is it? How tall is it? Who has experienced this before? Once I get some context of what the problem seems to be, I approximate a potential solution and work backwards. If this is what the solution *should* be, how can I works backwards from it to where I am now? I then try to break up those steps into bite size pieces and then move forwards, adjusting when necessary. 
<br>
## What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck? ##
<br>
I talk to my rubber ducky of course! In lieu of an actual rubber ducky, I just talked out loud to myself like a crazy person, until I come up with my crazy solution. It also helps if I take a break and some moments of not thinking about code. If it's during the day, I will go outside into my backyard. If it's at night, I will make myself come tea and change which room I am in so that I have a full change of scenery. Those things usually help.
