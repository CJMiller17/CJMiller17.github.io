## Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why? ##

Having only been exposed to React, I enjoy Javascript libraries. React has a large learning curve, which made it pretty hard to use. However, I can intuitively discern how powerful React can be and I can tell that I am going to thoroughly enjoy it once I understand it better. If other libraries and frameworks are like React, then I think they make life easier. 

## What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about? ##

There are a lot of interesting frameworks and libraries that I am interest in learning more about. A few that comes to mind are Vue, Angular, jQuery, and Node. I am curious how they all relate to one another and what problems they uniquely try to solve.  

## What is one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project? ##

There is a Javascript tool called minifier that I am interested in using. I know that lightweight and efficient code is incredibly important, especially as users expect shorter and shorter load times. The minifier shrinks the code and makes it as lightweight as possible.
