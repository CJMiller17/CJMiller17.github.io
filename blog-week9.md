## What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary? ##

I have learned that a command line interface, or CLI is very powerful. Anything that you can do "normally" on a computer, you can do through the CLI. Want to create a new folder? No problem for the CLI. You would like to move a file? The CLI can do that! You would like to delete something? The CLI can do that too.

It was scary at first to use the CLI, but not any more. At first, it was scary because there is no immediate feedback telling you that what you did was the correct thing done the correct way. I created folders in weird places. I deleted files I didn't mean to. I created folders inside folders inside folders. It was like the movie Inception, but way less amusing. Once I got a hang of it though, I really enjoyed using the CLI. Also, as we move toward Python, I am excited to start using it more. 

## If you were to build a CLI, what would it do? ##

If I were to build a CLI, I think I would make a mystery game or something like that. I really enjoy escape rooms and mystery video games. I would probably create a CLI that acted as if a person needed you to solve puzzles in order to save them.

## List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code ##

Frameworks make life easier and often times make coding more efficient. Without a framework or a library, I would be left to reinvent the wheel. It is important to at least learn how the wheel is built, but if I have to rebuild one for every single project, a lot of time would be wasted. Frameworks and libraries increase efficiency and consistency across teams and across projects.
